### Project Description
###### description
This mobile project was initially thought as WEB and to be something "Simple", but that would help me study reactJS, reactNative(now with the mobile version) and nodeJS - worrying about accessibility. The goal of the project is to be a widget where the user can send feedback, be it a bug, an improvement idea or any other feedback that doesn't fit in these other two categories, besides that, the user will have the option to insert a screenshot, but the user won't have to take a screenshot, since by clicking the button the screenshot is automatically made and applied in the feedback. When sending this feedback, it is entered into a database and emailed to the developers, meaning **me**.

### Techniques and Technologies

- Phosphor-react (for the icons)
